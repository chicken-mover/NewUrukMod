 tlon_ideas: "Tlönic Ideas"
 tlon_ideas_start: "Tlön Traditions"
 tlon_ideas_bonus: "Tlön Ambitions"
 hronir: "Hronir"
 hronir_desc: "\"The methodical fabrication of hronir has performed prodigious services for archaeologists. It has made possible the interrogation and even the modification of the past, which is now no less plastic and docile than the future.\""
 heresiarchy: "Heresiarchy"
 heresiarchy_desc: "The heresiarchs of Uqbar derive their power from the vague and capricious will of the people; the king who does not govern well does not remain king for long."
 berkeleian_idealism: "Berkeleian Idealism"
 berkeleian_idealism_desc: "In a world of purely sensory reality from which the Judeo-Christian God has been extracted, the deterministic arts of physics lose their omniscient enforcer of cause and effect, and strategems that depend on the destruction of this or that stronghold often find their accomplishments inverted at the last possible moment."
 the_uqbarain: "The Uqbarain"
 the_uqbarain_desc: "The variegated strains of Tlönic religious fanatacism are notoriously resistant to outside influence or subversion. The elevation of these dogmatists to a powerful political class will secure a place of respect for Tlön on the diplomatic stage."
 autochthonous_mystics: "Autochthonous Mystics"
 autochthonous_mystics_desc: "The riddles of Tlön swirl around the essential inseparability of the Tlönite from his desert; indeed, at times the entire people seems to be made of the sand itself, as abundant and as inhospitable."
 our_noiseless_land: "Our Noiseless Land"
 our_noiseless_land_desc: "It is said that even if one's knowledge of Uqbar extends to each individual grain in the wastes of Tlön, and even if one calls each particle by name, that the resulting configuration of words would constitute a book that no voice can speak aloud."
 the_labyrinth: "The Labyrinth"
 the_labyrinth_desc: "\"The army seized crucial bridges and roadways that revealed themselves to be traps with no exit; attack squadrons struggled to escape impromptu labyrinths; sieges of defensive ramparts broke through into empty desert. Finally, a diminishing living fraction of the army was absorbed into the fabric of the city itself, while somewhere aloft its commander's entrails splashed down the long steps of the Heresiarch's tower.\""
 mlejnas_ideas: "Mlejnas Ideas"
 mlejnas_ideas_start: "Mlejnas Traditions"
 mlejnas_ideas_bonus: "Mlejnas Ambitions"
 home_of_lost_objects: "Home of Lost Objects"
 home_of_lost_objects_desc: "\"It doesn't just see you, it knows you. It understands you. It keeps all of your secrets and every thought you've ever had. Safe. Waiting for you to come back and claim them.\""
 inevitability: "Inevitability"
 inevitability_desc: "Go back? Good gods, I never left. You cannot leave Mlejnas! You cannot even go there. It is something which develops inside you for many years, until one day you look up and you are there. And then you know what it is right away. There is no leaving that place. Living with it, maybe. But I am still there now."
 towers_of_blood: "Towers of Blood"
 towers_of_blood_desc: "What is the relationship between Mlejnas and Tlön? Some think the horrific monuments on Tlön's southern frontier, which seem to occupy a land between imagination and reality--a difficult distinction in Uqbar--both prefigure and record the awakening of the terrible orthodoxy spreading over the world."
 final_heresy: "The Final Heresy"
 final_heresy_desc: "Even the people who now flee before the armies of Mlejnas ackowledge a certain rightness or inevitability about the new Uqbarain doctrine, as if the puzzle of Tlön has been solved, thus being supplanted by an inescapable conclusion about the nature of the world itself."
 ancient_vault: "Ancient Vault Under the Sand"
 ancient_vault_desc: "You ever wonder why their buildings are full of holes, their poetry rife with lacunae? They ripped something out of themselves and buried it in the sand, and they are either too ashamed or to afraid to say what it was. I've gone too far to turn back now, I'm too close. But I'm very afraid of what it is I'm going to find."
 city_of_eyes: "City of Eyes"
 city_of_eyes_desc: "The people of Uqbar never spoke of it, because it was a source of great guilt to them, a sister city destroyed by a tragedy they could not prevent. No one ever speaks of the nature of the tradgedy, though. They shake their head and mutter something about fire or flood and change the subject."
 always_underneath: "Always Underneath"
 always_underneath_desc: "A myth. A fairytale. Another one of those sick jokes they come up with in Tlön. I don't know. I thought it was all of those things and more. But no, it's real. I don't know where, I don't know how. Maybe it moves, maybe it's following us, always under our feet. Maybe if I went outside and got a shovel we could dig down deep enough and find it waiting for you and me right now. "
