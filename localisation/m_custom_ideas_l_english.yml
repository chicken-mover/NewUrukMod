 hronir: "Hronir"
 hronir_desc: "\"The methodical fabrication of hronir has performed prodigious services for archaeologists. It has made possible the interrogation and even the modification of the past, which is now no less plastic and docile than the future.\""
 heresiarchy: "Heresiarchy"
 heresiarchy_desc: "The heresiarchs of Uqbar derive their power from the vague and capricious will of the people; the king who does not govern well does not remain king for long."
 berkeleian_idealism: "Berkeleian Idealism"
 berkeleian_idealism_desc: "In a world of purely sensory reality from which the Judeo-Christian God has been extracted, the deterministic arts of physics lose their omniscient enforcer of cause and effect, and strategems that depend on the destruction of this or that stronghold often find their accomplishments inverted at the last possible moment."
 the_uqbarain: "The Uqbarain"
 the_uqbarain_desc: "The variegated strains of Tlönic religious fanatacism are notoriously resistant to outside influence or subversion. The elevation of these dogmatists to a protected class will secure a place of respect for Tlön on the diplomatic stage."
 autochthonous_mystics: "Autochthonous Mystics"
 autochthonous_mystics_desc: "The riddles of Tlön swirl around the essential inseparability of the Tlönite from his desert; indeed, at times the entire people seems to be made of the sand itself, as abundant and as inhospitable."
 our_noiseless_land: "Our Noiseless Land"
 our_noiseless_land_desc: "It is said that even if one's knowledge of Uqbar extends even to each individual grain in the wastes of Tlön, and even if one calls each particle by name, that the resulting configuration of words would constitute a book that no voice can speak aloud."
 the_labyrinth: "The Labyrinth"
 the_labyrinth_desc: "\"The army seized crucial bridges and roadways that revealed themselves to be traps with no exit; attack squadrons struggled to escape impromptu labyrinths; sieges of defensive ramparts broke through into empty desert. Finally, a diminishing living fraction of the army was absorbed into the fabric of the city itself, while somewhere aloft its commander's entrails splashed down the long steps of the Heresiarch's tower.\""
